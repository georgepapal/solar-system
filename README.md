🌌 Solar System Simulation

A Python + Pygame project that simulates the Solar System to scale.
This simulation accurately represents the sizes, distances, and orbital periods of the planets around the Sun.

✨ Features

🪐 Planets to scale: Distances and sizes are proportional to the real Solar System.

☀️ Sun-centered simulation with accurate orbital speeds.

🎮 Built with Python and Pygame for smooth visualization.

📏 Scaled down for visualization, so the entire system fits on screen.

🚀 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).
Install dependencies with:

pip install pygame



🧮 Scaling Notes

Distances between planets are scaled down by a large factor to fit the screen.

Planet sizes are exaggerated slightly so they remain visible.

Orbital periods are calculated based on real astronomical data.


📚 Future Improvements

Add moons (e.g., Earth’s Moon, Jupiter’s Galilean moons).

Implement zoom and camera controls.

Add orbital trails for better visualization.
